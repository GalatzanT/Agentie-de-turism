#Tourism Agency


Written in C++, using Qt for the GUI.

The project is designed to manage travel agency operations based on OOP principles. The application allows users to manage travel packages, including creating, updating, and deleting packages, as well as handling client reservations.

I'm working on making the graphical interface for this project using Qt.
